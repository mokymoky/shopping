        <h2>About Nathan's Pizza</h2>
        <p> Welcome to Nathan's Pizza, not a real pizza place! This was inspired by a time when our
        creator of the website, Nathan, had a terrible experience with Uber Eats and Pizano's so he
        decided to order from their website, which was even worse! We at Nathan's Pizza are trying
        to make a better website for our customers so they can ACTUALLY ORDER A PIZZA WITHOUT A
        BRAIN ANEURYSM.</p>
